# hellBot

A configurable multitask bot I developed for my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/M9CvPvd42H) and my friend's ones

# Features

- moderation
- help for games
- temp voice channels

# Commands

### Moderation

- `/ban [reason]` bans a guild member
- `/kick [reason]` kicks a guild member
- `/mute [time] [reason]` mutes a guild member for a certain period of time
- `/warn [reason]` warns a guild member, taking a second warn in a certain period of time will mute him
- `/unmute`
- `/unwarn`
- `/resetwarn` resets the warn level (if you get muted by warn, your warn level increases and mute duration gets higher)

### Help for games

- `phasmo [category] [target]` gets information on a Google Doc I wrote and writes it on Discord

### Temp voice channels

- `/voicecreate [name] [limit]` creates a voice channel which will create a new temp voice channel when joined


## Other informations
